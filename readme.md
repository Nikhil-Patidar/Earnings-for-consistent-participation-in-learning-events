## Project Title
Earnings For Participation

## Project Description
The "Earnings For Participation" smart contract is a decentralized application that rewards participants for joining events. Participants can earn rewards for every event they participate in, and the rewards are tracked per participant. The contract allows the owner to create events and update reward amounts. Participants can query their total earnings and participation count.

This contract ensures transparency and fairness in the distribution of rewards, while allowing event organizers (the contract owner) to manage the reward system.

## Project Vision
The vision for "Earnings For Participation" is to provide a simple, transparent, and decentralized way for participants to earn rewards for their engagement. Whether for virtual events, community-driven projects, or incentive-based activities, this contract allows event organizers to easily distribute rewards and track participation. This model can be applied across various industries to motivate engagement and foster community involvement.

## Key Features

- **Reward Distribution:** Participants earn a set reward every time they participate in an event.
  
- **Event Creation by Owner:** Only the owner (creator of the contract) can create new events, enabling controlled and secure event creation.

- **Reward Management:** The owner can update the reward amount, providing flexibility in changing reward structures based on project needs.

- **Participant Tracking:** Every participant's total earnings and the number of events they've participated in are tracked. This ensures transparency and fairness.

- **Events Validation:** Participation is only allowed if at least one event has been created, ensuring that there is an active event before participants can earn rewards.

- **Owner-Only Actions:** Critical contract management functions like event creation and reward updates are restricted to the owner for security.


## Future Improvements
The following features and improvements are planned for future versions of the contract:

- **Tiered Reward System:** Introduce a system where rewards increase based on the number of events a participant joins or based on specific milestones they reach.
  
- **Multi-Owner Support:** Allow for multiple owners or administrators to manage events and rewards, enabling a more decentralized and community-driven system.

- **Event Voting/Approval:** Add functionality where events need to be voted or approved by a community or trusted group of people before they are officially created.

- **Dynamic Reward Adjustment:** Implement a system where the reward amount can be dynamically adjusted based on participation or external factors (e.g., event popularity or budget constraints).

- **Referral Program:** Introduce a referral system where participants can earn additional rewards by bringing in new participants.

- **Support for Custom Event Logic:** Allow for more complex event setups, such as events with different durations, special conditions, or participant requirements.

- **Better UI Integration:** Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the contract, making it easier for participants to join events, claim rewards, and track their progress.
